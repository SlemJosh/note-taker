# Note Taker App

## Description

This app was a project of refactoring work that was provided to me at the UoU coding bootcamp.  My task was to create a server.js file and to implement several functions to correspond with the other files I was given. In short I was tasked with designing functions that would allow a user to create, store, and even delete notes on their user side, while taking instructions from the server side on how to pull up and view those notes.  This task was mostly built out so it was just a about going through each step to achieve the initial expectations. The challenges that arose were that I wanted to make some changes to the files provided for me, as I wanted to enhance the user experience.  I however used restraint as it's an exercise in just doing what a client might request vs changing their own files.  In this readme I have the opportunity to express some of the places that I would like to see changed.  I would like to see how the notes are entered include some hitting the enter key to complete one line of required text and then moving on to the next line, as well as at the final text prompt proceeding with saving the users data.  In my code, I also found several places where I would do some error handling to hopefully make the user experience smoother.  Ultimately this project was a good example of how to blend server side programming with the user side code.

## Installation

This project does require node as well as multiple npm's to install. Those npms include fs, path, and express that allow us to write to a file, and be able to navigate through our directory to that file.  The express also helps us build an api that lets the user view information that is posted. This project is also deployed at the following address where no installation is necessary.

If you are using this on your own terminal. Make sure that node is installed.  Then start with npm install fs, npm install path, npm install express.  Once all those  npms are installed, you would simple type , npm start into the terminal.  It will then  tell you that the server has been started with a link to the port so you can view it.  On the HTML itself, you would simply click the get started button and it would take you to the note page.  You would need to fill out a note title and a note text and then a save button will appear to which you will click and the information will be saved and avaiable for you to view on the left side of your screen. You may also delete the notes once you decide you no longer need them, by clicking the trashcan icon next to that specific note.
